# Simple Time Tracker â€” WIP

A very simple tool to keep an eye on where you spend your time, it's meant to track time accurately so that you don't wonder where all the time in the day goes at the end of it.

I found my self cheating my way out of responsibility by telling myself that I don't have a lot of time to get things done, while the whole available time is distributed across various activities that are of low if not no priority. Sometimes I tell myself "Oh the day is too short; I've spent the whole day working on this!", in fact the time spent **actually** working is so dimished compared the one I though I spent working.

It's really hard to acheive the "zen" mode focus: where you you experience this very long and concentrated session of work with no interuption, that is why I though I really need a timer so I can't fool myself about how much work I've put in.

I haven't found an easy and fast way to just stop a timer once your focus shifts to something else, so I made a very simple one that just gets the job done.
